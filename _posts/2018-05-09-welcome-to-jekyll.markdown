So I guess I have been really outdated with things since it took me a while to create a free static webpage here in github. I used [Hugo][hugo] and [Netlify][netlify] before (it seems bad of me citing a competitor here but I really did use them!).

What really made me use [Github Pages][github-pages] is that it has a nice URL (<i>username</i>.github.io). I need to familiarize my self with the markdown language [Jekyll][jekyll] defaulted to (seems like it is [kramdown][kramdown]).

I'll eventually try to beautify this page as soon as I have the time to. At the time I am writing this, I am using the default theme (which is minima). I'll be sure to check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.

For now, I shall sleep..
